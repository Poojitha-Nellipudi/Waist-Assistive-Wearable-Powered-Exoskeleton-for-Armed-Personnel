# Waist-Assistive-Wearable-Powered-Exoskeleton-for-Armed-Personnel

Armed personnel in the military requires strength and power to walk with loaded guns. A powered exoskeleton enhances the strength and supports the weight of the payload, thereby reducing the effort required by the soldier. In this project, a lower extremity exoskeleton was designed to enhance the strength and to supply the power required to support the waist, torso, and lower body.

Following objectives were fulfilled in the project.
1. Kinematic analysis was performed based on the assumed arrangement
2. Developed an algorithm in MATLAB to simulate human walking
3. Stabilized the walking pattern of biped in real-time environments
4. Implemented the stabilized walking pattern of biped in the exoskeleton
5. Designed a 3-D CAD model of the exoskeleton
